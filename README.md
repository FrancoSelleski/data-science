# Data-Science

In this repo I'll be uploading data science challenges I solve. It's main goal is for me to be able to share my work and experience with other developers.

Challenges uploaded so far:
  * Stock price prediction: predict price of a stock using RNN models based on LSTM modules using past price.
  * Online purchase intention: predict the likelihood of a customer buying in an online shop using relevant info such as how much time the customer browses and day of the week (among others).
  * Wine quality: predict quality of wine using physical/chemical attributes such as alcohol percentage.
